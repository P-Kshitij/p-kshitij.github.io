I am pre-final year student of Mathematics and Computing at IIT-BHU. My fields of interest include Theory and Applications of Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Generative Modelling among others. Recently I have been working with Prof. <a href = "https://iacs.seas.harvard.edu/people/pavlos-protopapas">Pavlos Protopapas</a> in the StellarDNN lab at IACS, Harvard.  I also find a lot of pure math courses super fascinating and try to write about my understanding here.
