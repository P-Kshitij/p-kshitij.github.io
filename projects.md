I have done a couple of cool projects. Find them here.

### 1. Automatic sentiment, brand identification and headline generation pipeline
 This was done as a part of a InterIIT Tech Meet'21 challenge. We made this over 25 days in a team of 7. We were awarded a **Silver medal** among top teams from 18 IITs. More info [here](https://github.com/P-Kshitij/AHSG-InterIIT)

### 2. Reproducing BioBERT paper for NER task
 This was done in an effort to become more familiar with finetuning BERT on harder tasks like NER. Starting from scratch, I tried to finetune BERT on the datasets used in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.08746). Moreover I wrote accurate evaluation scripts which can be a bit confusing in NER. More info on Github [here](https://github.com/P-Kshitij/BioBertRepro)

### 3. Twitter BERT Visualizer
 The idea here is to visualize the public opinion around a hashtag in a convinient and semantic manner. I built a system to retrieve some recent tweets of a hashtag, pass them through BERT to get embeddings and then plot them in 2D using T-SNE. Gives a nice plot with tweets arranged according to their sentiment. Sample plot [here](https://keen-pike-0f2ba8.netlify.app/). More info [here](https://github.com/P-Kshitij/TwitBertVis)
